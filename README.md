# DatasheetVisualizer
When you have a lot of datasheets to look up for this tool can become handy in order to have all the datasheet in the same program, you can quickly read them and add some "notes" that will automatically bring you to a specific page. (e.g. Note: PC104 will bring you to the page with the PC104 pins description)
